# Learn DuckDB

_üöß This collection is a work in progress. Please help us add notebooks!_

This collection of marimo notebooks is designed to teach you the basics of
DuckDB, a fast in-memory OLAP engine that can interoperate with Dataframes.
These notebooks also show how marimo gives DuckDB superpowers.
