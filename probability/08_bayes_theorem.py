        # Bayes' Theorem

        _This notebook is a computational companion to the book ["Probability for Computer Scientists"](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/part1/bayes_theorem/), by Stanford professor Chris Piech._

        In the 1740s, an English minister named Thomas Bayes discovered a profound mathematical relationship that would revolutionize how we reason about uncertainty. His theorem provides an elegant framework for calculating the probability of a hypothesis being true given observed evidence.

        At its core, Bayes' Theorem connects two different types of probabilities: the probability of a hypothesis given evidence $P(H|E)$, and its reverse - the probability of evidence given a hypothesis $P(E|H)$. This relationship is particularly powerful because it allows us to compute difficult probabilities using ones that are easier to measure.

        ## The Heart of Bayesian Reasoning

        The fundamental insight of Bayes' Theorem lies in its ability to relate what we want to know with what we can measure. When we observe evidence $E$, we often want to know the probability of a hypothesis $H$ being true. However, it's typically much easier to measure how likely we are to observe the evidence when we know the hypothesis is true.

        This reversal of perspective - from $P(H|E)$ to $P(E|H)$ - is powerful because it lets us:
        1. Start with what we know (prior beliefs)
        2. Use easily measurable relationships (likelihood)
        3. Update our beliefs with new evidence

        This approach mirrors both how humans naturally learn and the scientific method: we begin with prior beliefs, gather evidence, and update our understanding based on that evidence. This makes Bayes' Theorem not just a mathematical tool, but a framework for rational thinking.

        ## The Formula

        Bayes' Theorem states:

        $P(H|E) = \frac{P(E|H)P(H)}{P(E)}$

        Where:

        - $P(H|E)$ is the **posterior probability** - probability of hypothesis H given evidence E
        - $P(E|H)$ is the **likelihood** - probability of evidence E given hypothesis H
        - $P(H)$ is the **prior probability** - initial probability of hypothesis H
        - $P(E)$ is the **evidence** - total probability of observing evidence E

        The denominator $P(E)$ can be expanded using the [Law of Total Probability](https://marimo.app/gh/marimo-team/learn/main?entrypoint=probability%2F07_law_of_total_probability.py):

        $P(E) = P(E|H)P(H) + P(E|H^c)P(H^c)$

        - Based on previous knowledge or assumptions
        - Example: Probability of having a disease before any tests

        ### 2. Likelihood - $P(E|H)$
        - Probability of evidence given hypothesis is true
        - Often known from data or scientific studies
        - Example: Probability of positive test given disease present

        ### 3. Evidence - $P(E)$
        - Total probability of observing the evidence
        - Acts as a normalizing constant
        - Can be calculated using Law of Total Probability

        ### 4. Posterior - $P(H|E)$
        - Updated probability after considering evidence
        - Combines prior knowledge with new evidence
        - Becomes new prior for future updates

        - **Want to know**: $P(\text{Location}|\text{Signal Strength})$ - Probability of phone location given signal
        - **Easy to know**: $P(\text{Signal Strength}|\text{Location})$ - Signal strength at known locations
        - **Causality**: Location determines signal strength, not vice versa
