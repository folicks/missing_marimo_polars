        # Probability of Or

        When calculating the probability of either one event _or_ another occurring, we need to be careful about how we combine probabilities. The method depends on whether the events can happen together[<sup>1</sup>](https://chrispiech.github.io/probabilityForComputerScientists/en/part1/prob_or/).

        Let's explore how to calculate $P(E \cup F)$, i.e. $P(E \text{ or } F)$, in different scenarios.

        ## Mutually Exclusive Events

        Two events $E$ and $F$ are **mutually exclusive** if they cannot occur simultaneously. 
        In set notation, this means:

        $E \cap F = \emptyset$

        For example:

        - Rolling an even number (2,4,6) vs rolling an odd number (1,3,5)
        - Drawing a heart vs drawing a spade from a deck
        - Passing vs failing a test

        Here's a Python function to check if two sets of outcomes are mutually exclusive:

        ## Or with Mutually Exclusive Events

        For mutually exclusive events, the probability of either event occurring is simply the sum of their individual probabilities:

        $P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F)$

        This extends to multiple events. For $n$ mutually exclusive events $E_1, E_2, \ldots, E_n$:

        $P(E_1 \cup E_2 \cup \cdots \cup E_n) = \sum_{i=1}^n P(E_i)$

        ## Or with Non-Mutually Exclusive Events

        When events can occur together, we need to use the **inclusion-exclusion principle**:

        $P(E \cup F) = P(E) + P(F) - P(E \cap F)$

        Why subtract $P(E \cap F)$? Because when we add $P(E)$ and $P(F)$, we count the overlap twice!

        For example, consider calculating $P(\text{prime or even})$ when rolling a die:

        - Prime numbers: {2, 3, 5}
        - Even numbers: {2, 4, 6}
        - The number 2 is counted twice unless we subtract its probability

        ### Extension to Three Events

        For three events, the inclusion-exclusion principle becomes:
