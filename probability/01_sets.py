        # Sets

        Probability is the study of "events", assigning numerical values to how likely
        events are to occur. For example, probability lets us quantify how likely it is for it to rain or shine on a given day.


        Typically we reason about _sets_ of events. In mathematics,
        a set is a collection of elements, with no element included more than once.
        Elements can be any kind of object.

        For example:

        - ☀️ Weather events: $\{\text{Rain}, \text{Overcast}, \text{Clear}\}$
        - 🎲 Die rolls: $\{1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6\}$
        - 🪙 Pairs of coin flips = $\{ \text{(Heads, Heads)}, \text{(Heads, Tails)}, \text{(Tails, Tails)} \text{(Tails, Heads)}\}$

        Sets are the building blocks of probability, and will arise frequently in our study.

        ## Set builder notation

        To compactly describe the elements in a set, we can use **set builder notation**, which specifies conditions that must be true for elements to be in the set.

        For example, here is how to specify the set of positive numbers less than 10:

        \[
        \{x \mid 0 < x < 10 \}
        \]

        The predicate to the right of the vertical bar $\mid$ specifies conditions that must be true for an element to be in the set; the expression to the left of $\mid$ specifies the value being included.

        In Python, set builder notation is called a "set comprehension."
