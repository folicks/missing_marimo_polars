        ## And with Independent Events

        Two events $E$ and $F$ are **independent** if knowing one event occurred doesn't affect the probability of the other. 
        For independent events:

        $P(E \text{ and } F) = P(E) \cdot P(F)$

        For example:

        - Rolling a 6 on one die and getting heads on a coin flip
        - Drawing a heart from a deck, replacing it, and drawing another heart
        - Getting a computer error on Monday vs. Tuesday

        ## And with Dependent Events

        where $P(F|E)$ is the probability of $F$ occurring given that $E$ has occurred.
