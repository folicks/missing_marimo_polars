        # Least squares

        In a least-squares problem, we have measurements $A \in \mathcal{R}^{m \times
        n}$ (i.e., $m$ rows and $n$ columns) and $b \in \mathcal{R}^m$. We seek a vector
        $x \in \mathcal{R}^{n}$ such that $Ax$ is close to $b$. The matrices $A$ and $b$ are problem data or constants, and $x$ is the variable we are solving for.

        Closeness is defined as the sum of the squared differences:

        \[ \sum_{i=1}^m (a_i^Tx - b_i)^2, \]

        also known as the $\ell_2$-norm squared, $\|Ax - b\|_2^2$.

        For example, we might have a dataset of $m$ users, each represented by $n$ features. Each row $a_i^T$ of $A$ is the feature vector for user $i$, while the corresponding entry $b_i$ of $b$ is the measurement we want to predict from $a_i^T$, such as ad spending. The prediction for user $i$ is given by $a_i^Tx$.

        We find the optimal value of $x$ by solving the optimization problem

        \[
            \begin{array}{ll}
            \text{minimize}   & \|Ax - b\|_2^2.
            \end{array}
        \]

        Let $x^\star$ denote the optimal $x$. The quantity $r = Ax^\star - b$ is known as the residual. If $\|r\|_2 = 0$, we have a perfect fit.
