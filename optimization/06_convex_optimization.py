        # Convex optimization

        In the previous tutorials, we learned about least squares, linear programming,
        and quadratic programming, and saw applications of each. We also learned that these problem
        classes can be solved efficiently and reliably using CVXPY. That's because these problem classes are a special
        case of a more general class of tractable problems, called **convex optimization problems.**

        A convex optimization problem is an optimization problem that minimizes a convex
        function, subject to affine equality constraints and convex inequality
        constraints ($f_i(x)\leq 0$, where $f_i$ is a convex function).

        **CVXPY.** CVXPY lets you specify and solve any convex optimization problem,
        abstracting away the more specific problem classes. You start with CVXPY's **atomic functions**, like `cp.exp`, `cp.log`, and `cp.square`, and compose them to build more complex convex functions. As long as the functions are composed in the right way â€” as long as they are "DCP-compliant" â€”  your resulting problem will be convex and solvable by CVXPY.
