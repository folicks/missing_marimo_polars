        # Minimal fuel optimal control

        This notebook includes an application of linear programming to controlling a
        physical system, adapted from [Convex
        Optimization](https://web.stanford.edu/~boyd/cvxbook/) by Boyd and Vandenberghe.

        We consider a linear dynamical system with state $x(t) \in \mathbf{R}^n$, for $t = 0, \ldots, T$. At each time step $t = 0, \ldots, T - 1$, an actuator or input signal $u(t)$ is applied, affecting the state. The dynamics
        of the system is given by the linear recurrence

        \[
            x(t + 1) = Ax(t) + bu(t), \quad t = 0, \ldots, T - 1,
        \]

        where $A \in \mathbf{R}^{n \times n}$ and $b \in \mathbf{R}^n$ are given and encode how the system evolves. The initial state $x(0)$ is also given.

        The _minimum fuel optimal control problem_ is to choose the inputs $u(0), \ldots, u(T - 1)$ so as to achieve
        a given desired state $x_\text{des} = x(T)$ while minimizing the total fuel consumed

        \[
        F = \sum_{t=0}^{T - 1} f(u(t)).
        \]

        The function $f : \mathbf{R} \to \mathbf{R}$ tells us how much fuel is consumed as a function of the input, and is given by

        \[
            f(a) = \begin{cases}
            |a| & |a| \leq 1 \\
            2|a| - 1 & |a| > 1.
            \end{cases}
        \]

        This means the fuel use is proportional to the magnitude of the signal between $-1$ and $1$, but for larger signals the marginal fuel efficiency is half.

        **This notebook.** In this notebook we use CVXPY to formulate the minimum fuel optimal control problem as a linear program. The notebook lets you play with the initial and target states, letting you see how they affect the planned trajectory of inputs $u$.

        First, we create the **problem data**.
